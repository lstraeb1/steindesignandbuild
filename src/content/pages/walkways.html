    <!-- ============================================ 
        This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
        that have no design or layout.  Often times these are 
        content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
        to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the 
        content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
        of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all 
        about making the content accessible and easy to read.
